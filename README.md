# Coding Quiz

This project was made to utilise API's, Timers, and different OOP methods within JS. The program should welcome the user with a simple instruction page and button to begin the quiz. The quiz should be a multiple choice based question set on Computer Science, Coding and JS. When the user begins the quiz, a timer should begin counting down. If the user gets a question wrong then the timer should lose a block of 5 seconds. The quiz ends when the user has answered all questions or the timer expires. The user should be able to see how many questions they got correct and incorrect, as well as the total amount of questions asked. At the end of the quiz, there should also be a High-Score display which allows initial input and highest score, to be stored locally.
